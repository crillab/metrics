c SAT4J PB solver for KTH experiments
c version CUSTOM.v20200207
c Cutting planes based inference (org.sat4j.pb.core.PBSolverCP)
c  - never skip resolution steps
c  - Auto-division on coefficients is disabled
c  - No postprocessing
c  - Conflict is considered as is when resolving
c  - Weaken reason to find a multiple of the pivot
c  - Weaken first using unassigned literals
c --- Begin Solver configuration ---
c org.sat4j.pb.constraints.PBMaxClauseCardConstrDataStructure@2d8f65a4
c Learn all clauses as in MiniSAT
c LOGGER=java.util.logging.Logger@6ee52dcd claDecay=0.999 varDecay=0.95 conflictBoundIncFactor=1.5 initConflictBound=100 
c VSIDS like heuristics from MiniSAT using a heap phase appearing in latest learned clause taking into account the objective function
c No reason simplification
c Armin Biere (Picosat) restarts strategy
c Glucose 2 learned constraints deletion strategy (LBD updated on propagation) with timer check every 1000 if the learned constraints reach increasing bounds: 5000 step 1000
